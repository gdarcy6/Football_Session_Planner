# Football_Session_Planner
I created an app that contains a list of drills that are used regularly to select from when planning a session.
The app has a start and end time for each drill so you can accurately plan out your session.
You can add notes on drills for explanation or more info for sharing with coaches/players
Add player names from your squad and their position. You can select the players available for your session and a position table will be generated that 
will give you how many players are available per position.
